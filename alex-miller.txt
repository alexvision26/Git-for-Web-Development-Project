Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    Block elements create a new 'block' and split up segments. (Such as <p>) Inline blocks
    can be used within block elements without dividing into segments. (Such as <span>, <a>, <strong>)

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
    Absolute positioning confines the element to it's own layer and will not interfere with the other
    elements within the document.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
    By using the display:block element. It starts on a new line and takes up the whole space, but allows customization
    of the width.

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display
    inline-block by default
    3 block: <p> <h1> <address> | 2 inline: <span> <strong> | 1 inline-block: <nav>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?
    The box model is the 'box' or variable space that surrounds all elements in HTML. They are layered inside out starting from
    content>padding>border>margin. A fix for the box model can be done in CSS using box-sizing:border-box that will become much
    more supported by most browsers by including the padding and border within the content width.
